## Post 1: r/optics

**Title:** I built a free browser-based Gaussian beam propagation tool — ABCD matrix method, visual element editor

**Body:**

Built a free web app for Gaussian beam propagation using the ABCD matrix method. Define your optical system (free space, lenses, curved mirrors, interfaces), and it traces the beam through the system showing waist size, divergence, and Rayleigh range at every point.

Handles complex beam parameter transformation — enter your input beam wavelength and waist, add optical elements, and see how the beam evolves. Great for designing beam expanders, telescopes, and laser delivery systems.

Open source and runs in the browser with no install required.

Would love feedback from optical engineers — what features would make this useful for your lab?

## Post 2: r/photonics

**Title:** Free Gaussian beam ABCD matrix calculator — beam propagation through lenses, mirrors, interfaces in your browser

**Body:**

I built a free browser-based tool for Gaussian beam propagation. Define an optical train with lenses, mirrors, free space, and flat interfaces — it computes the complex beam parameter at every point using ABCD matrix multiplication.

Shows beam radius evolution, waist locations, and Rayleigh ranges for quick optical system design checks.

What would photonics engineers want? Multi-wavelength? Astigmatic beams? Let me know.

## Post 3: r/physics

**Title:** Free Gaussian beam propagation tool — ABCD matrix method in your browser

**Body:**

Built a free web tool for tracing Gaussian beams through optical systems using the ABCD ray transfer matrix. Supports free space, thin lenses, curved mirrors, and dielectric interfaces. Computes beam waist, divergence, and Rayleigh range throughout.

No install, no account, open source. Handy for teaching optics or quick lab calculations.

Feedback welcome — especially from people teaching or doing lab optics.
